# Ignite-Theatre

---

Newhaven's new theatre company Ignite Theatre are pleased
to announce their Christmas production of Wind in the
Willows, following the hugely successful production of
Memory of Water in the summer. The stage will be brought
to life with animated projections and live music.
Tickets will include the opportunity for children to have
their face painted and keep animal masks so that audience
members can be part of the exciting world of Toad Hall and
the winter forest. Snacks and drinks will be available so
arrive in good time for some Christmas activities and
wonderment before a truly magical performance.

This website aims to promote Ignite-Theatre and provide
information of up-coming performances.
